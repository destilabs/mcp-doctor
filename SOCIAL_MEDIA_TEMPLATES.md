ü©∫ Launching MCP Doctor: Open Source Diagnostic Tool for AI Agent Integration

I'm excited to share MCP Doctor, a comprehensive diagnostic tool I've built for developers working with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

üéØ THE PROBLEM
As AI agents become more sophisticated, ensuring MCP servers are "agent-friendly" has become critical. Poor tool descriptions, unclear parameters, and missing context can break agent workflows.

‚ö° THE SOLUTION
MCP Doctor performs lightning-fast analysis of MCP servers (both HTTP and NPX-launched) and provides actionable recommendations. No AI dependencies means consistent, sub-second results - perfect for rapid development iteration.

üîë KEY FEATURES
‚Ä¢ Rule-based analysis for speed and consistency
‚Ä¢ Security-first design with smart credential filtering
‚Ä¢ Support for multiple server types and output formats
‚Ä¢ Comprehensive diagnostic capabilities
‚Ä¢ Easy CLI and Python API

üöÄ BUILT FOR DEVELOPERS
Having worked extensively with AI systems, I know how frustrating it can be when tools don't work well with agents. MCP Doctor addresses real pain points I've experienced and heard from the community.

The project is fully open source and follows best practices:
‚úÖ Comprehensive test suite
‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline
‚úÖ Security scanning
‚úÖ Type checking
‚úÖ Detailed documentation

ü§ù COMMUNITY
If you're working with MCP servers, AI agents, or developer tools, I'd love your feedback! The project is designed to grow with community input.

Title: [P] MCP Doctor: Open Source Diagnostic Tool for Model Context Protocol Servers

I've built and open-sourced MCP Doctor, a diagnostic tool for developers working with Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and AI agents.

**The Problem:**
MCP servers often have unclear tool descriptions, poor parameter naming, and missing context, making them difficult for AI agents to use effectively. This leads to failed agent interactions and debugging headaches.

**The Solution:**
MCP Doctor performs comprehensive analysis of MCP servers and provides actionable recommendations. It's designed for speed (rule-based, not AI-powered) to support rapid development iteration.

**Key Features:**
- Lightning-fast analysis (sub-second results)
- Security-first with automatic credential filtering
- Support for HTTP and NPX-launched servers
- Multiple output formats (table, JSON, YAML)
- Python API for programmatic use

**Technical Details:**
- Built with async Python for performance
- Comprehensive test suite with CI/CD
- Type-checked with mypy
- Follows Anthropic's MCP best practices

**Demo Videos:**

### r/Python
```
Title: [Project] MCP Doctor - CLI tool for diagnosing Model Context Protocol servers

Built a Python CLI tool called MCP Doctor for analyzing MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers. It helps ensure servers work well with AI agents by checking tool descriptions, parameter schemas, and following best practices.

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.10+ with async/await
- Typer for CLI
- httpx for HTTP clients
- Rich for beautiful terminal output
- Comprehensive pytest suite

**Features:**
- Rule-based analysis (fast, consistent results)
- Support for HTTP and subprocess-launched servers
- Security-focused with credential filtering
- Multiple output formats
- Type hints throughout

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Clean separation between checkers, clients, and reports
- Async-first design for performance
- Extensible checker system for new diagnostics
- Proper error handling and logging

The codebase follows Python best practices with black formatting, isort imports, and mypy type checking. CI/CD pipeline ensures code quality.

**GitHub:** https://github.com/destilabs/mcp-doctor

Would appreciate feedback on the code structure and any suggestions for improvements!

### Newsletter Pitch
```
Subject: New Open Source Tool: MCP Doctor for AI Agent Development

Hi [Editor],

I wanted to share MCP Doctor, a new open source diagnostic tool that addresses growing needs in AI agent development.

**What it does:** Analyzes Model Context Protocol servers to ensure they work well with AI agents, providing actionable recommendations for improvement.

**Why it matters:** As AI agents become more prevalent, ensuring proper integration between agents and tools is critical. MCP Doctor solves real pain points developers face.

**What makes it interesting:**
- Takes a unique "speed-first" approach (rule-based vs AI-powered)
- Security-first design with credential protection
- Growing relevance as MCP ecosystem expands
- Built by someone with hands-on AI development experience

**Community traction:** [Update with actual metrics when available]

I'd be happy to provide more details, arrange a demo, or answer any questions if this fits your coverage area.

```

### 2-Minute Technical Overview
```
"If you're building AI agents that interact with external tools, you've probably run into this problem...

[Show failed agent interaction]

Your MCP server works, but agents can't use it effectively. The descriptions are unclear, parameters are confusing, and there's missing context.

That's why I built MCP Doctor.

[Show tool in action]

MCP Doctor analyzes your server in seconds and tells you exactly what needs fixing. Unlike other tools, it uses rule-based analysis for consistent, fast results.

[Show before/after comparison]

Here's the same server before and after applying MCP Doctor's recommendations. See the difference?

The tool is completely open source and designed for daily use. Try it on your next MCP server!"
